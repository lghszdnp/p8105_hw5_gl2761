```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(viridis)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
	echo = TRUE,
	warning = FALSE,
	fig.width = 8, 
  fig.height = 6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
```

## Problem 1

First import all the datasets into one single dataframe

```{r}
raw_df = 
  tibble(
    files = list.files("data/"),
    path = str_c("data/", files)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(data = map(path, read_csv)) %>% 
  unnest()
```

Clean the data and store them into a new dataframe called 'clean_df'

```{r}
clean_df = 
  raw_df %>% 
  mutate(
    files = str_replace(files, ".csv", ""),
    group = str_sub(files, 1, 3)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "outcome",
    names_prefix = "week_") %>% 
  mutate(week = as.numeric(week)) %>% 
  select(group, subj = files, week, outcome)
```

```{r}
clean_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = outcome, group = subj, color = group)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_path() + 
  facet_grid(~group)
```

According to the result shown above, outcome values of patients in the experiment group have an obvious trend of increase, while the trend in control patients seems to continue to vibrate in a certain range. On average, patients in the experiment group have a better outcome than patients in the control group.
